# Consistent Hashing

This repository serves as an educational resource for understanding consistent
hashing, featuring a practical implementation in Rust. It's important to note
that this resource is for learning purposes rather than production
use.

We begin with a basic implementation and gradually address its limitations in
following iterations.

## Implementations

1. [modulus hashing](./00_modulus_hashing/README.md): The simplest and most fragile version of a consistent hash.
